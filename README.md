ICS4U Final Project --> Produce code training game! -- Looking for a first job as a high school student? If you want to become a cashier at a grocery store, you will need to know your produce lookup codes to charge customers the correct prices for produce items. Learn them with this game!

I created this project as my final project for Grade 12 Computer Science, University Preparation.
